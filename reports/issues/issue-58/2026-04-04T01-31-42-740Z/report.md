## 🔍 Cross-Page Patterns: Common HTML Issues

These HTML patterns cause the same accessibility errors across multiple pages. **Fix the pattern once in your codebase to fix it everywhere!**

### 🎯 Top Patterns to Fix (Highest Impact)

#### Pattern 1: Affects 100 page(s) - 100 occurrence(s)

**Scanner**: axe
**Rule**: [region](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/region?application=playwright)
**Impact**: moderate
**Issue**: All page content should be contained by landmarks

**HTML Pattern**:
```html
<a data-module="govuk-skip-link" class="gem-c-skip-link govuk-skip-link govuk-!-display-none-print" href="#content" data-govuk-skip-link-init="" data-govuk-skip-link-module-started="true">Skip to main content</a>
```

**XPath** (use in browser DevTools):
```
.gem-c-skip-link
```

**How to Replicate**:
1. Open any affected page in your browser
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to Console tab
4. Run: `$x('.gem-c-skip-link')`
5. The element will be highlighted

**Affected Pages**:
- https://gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/getting-an-accessibility-audit

#### Pattern 2: Affects 100 page(s) - 100 occurrence(s)

**Scanner**: axe
**Rule**: [region](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/region?application=playwright)
**Impact**: moderate
**Issue**: All page content should be contained by landmarks

**HTML Pattern**:
```html
<h2 class="gem-c-feedback__prompt-question">Is this page useful?</h2>
```

**XPath** (use in browser DevTools):
```
.gem-c-feedback__prompt-question
```

**How to Replicate**:
1. Open any affected page in your browser
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to Console tab
4. Run: `$x('.gem-c-feedback__prompt-question')`
5. The element will be highlighted

**Affected Pages**:
- https://gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/getting-an-accessibility-audit
- https://gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/testing-for-accessibility
